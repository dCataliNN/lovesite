    content: `My dearest Daria,

On this National Girlfriend's Day, I want you to know how incredibly grateful I am for every single day of these amazing 3 years and 7 months we've shared together, even across the miles.

From our very first video call on December 12th, 2021, you've brought so much joy, laughter, and love into my life. You're not just my girlfriend - you're my best friend, my partner through every time zone, and the person who makes even the longest distance feel manageable.

I love how you light up on our video calls when you talk about things you're passionate about. I love your kindness, your patience with our situation, and the way you make everyone around you feel special. Most of all, I love how perfectly we connect, like two hearts that were always meant to beat in sync, no matter the miles between us.

These 3 years and 7 months have been filled with incredible memories - from late-night video calls to counting down days until our next visit, from sending care packages to falling asleep on call together. Every moment with you, virtual or in person, has been a gift.

The distance isn't easy, but you make it worth every single mile. You've taught me that love isn't about proximity - it's about connection, commitment, and choosing each other every single day.

As we continue this beautiful journey together, I want you to know that you are loved beyond measure. Thank you for being you, for choosing us despite the distance, and for making every day brighter with your love.

Happy National Girlfriend's Day, my love.

Forever yours ❤️`,
